			"body": "Hello, thanks for working on this awesome project! I've been trying to get everything working with TypeScript, and I just went down a huge rabbit hole before realizing that I had completely misunderstood how everything worked. (It's my first time using TypeScript, as well as all the bleeding edge versions for create-react-app, webpack, babel, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhen I ran `yarn start` for the first time with an `App.tsx`, I got this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe detected TypeScript in your project (src/App.tsx) and created a tsconfig.json file for you.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default `tsconfig.json` that it generates has this line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"target\": \"es5\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to use `Array.fill` in my code (and `Object.assign`, etc.), and this was giving me a TypeScript error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType error: Property 'fill' does not exist on type 'string[]'.  TS2339\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started investigating the issue, and I saw that I could fix it by using `\"target\": \"es6\"` in my `tsconfig.json`. But then I was concerned that the JS output from webpack would be ES6, and I would lose support for older browsers. I saw that I could also use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n target: \"es5\"\r\n lib: [\"es2018\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen TypeScript would emit ES5, but it would use the es2018 type declarations for type-checking (and would just assume that I was including my own polyfills.) That sounded a bit better, but then I was worried that I would lose tree shaking if TypeScript emitted ES5 (because then it would have `require` statements instead of ES6 modules.)\r\n\r\nI got very confused and was Googling things like \"TypeScript vs Babel\", and \"TypeScript => ES6 => Babel => ES5\", and there was no shortage of misleading answers and blog posts that were leading me down the wrong track.\r\n\r\nI finally started reading through the `react-scripts` webpack config and `babel-preset-react-app`, and I found that `create-react-app` is 100% Babel for all of the JS compilation, and it doesn't use any TS loaders (like `ts-loader` or `awesome-typescript-loader`.) Babel just strips all of the TS types and doesn't care about them. I also realized that the webpack config was using `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin` to run the TypeScript typechecking in a separate process, and then it asynchronously shows any TypeScript errors in the browser.\r\n\r\nAnd then it finally clicked! Or at least, I think I get it... Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of these points:\r\n\r\n* Babel doesn't care about `tsconfig.json` at all. It just strips all the TypeScript types, so this has nothing to do with the webpack build. \r\n* TypeScript is actually only used for type-checking, and the type-checking step doesn't actually care about `\"target\": \"es5\"` either, because it's not emitting any JavaScript. However, it does infer the type definitions from the target, and these can be overridden with the \"lib\" option.\r\n* The `create-react-app` webpack config already uses [`babel/preset-env` with a target of IE9](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/babel-preset-react-app/dependencies.js#L85-L91), so it does already include polyfills for `Object.assign`, `Array.from`, etc.\r\n\r\nSo is it correct that the only thing I need to do to fix these TypeScript errors is to just set `target: \"es6\"` (or `lib: [\"es2018\"]`) in my `tsconfig.json`? If so, I think it would be good if this was the default target."

It is an out-of-the-box CRA with greenlet installed and an example function written. If you change line 38 from `return {...{time: Date.now()}};` to `return {time: Date.now()};` then the code will run fine.\r\n\r\nI removed the node_modules folder to make the zip a reasonable size, so don't forget to `npm i` before running!\r\n\r\n[greenlet-spread-issue.zip](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/files/2568641/greenlet-spread-issue.zip)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n  \r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n  \r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nWe use greenlet in to make dealing with webworkers easier. In our app, we have a page that needs to load in excess of 50,000 records from an API call for reporting purposes. The data we receive back from the API needs to be massaged into data structures that are easy to work with in our charting library, and this work is done inside of a webworker to avoid blocking the main thread."

In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a server that responds to OPTIONS requests by adding a `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with a value that matches the request's \"origin\" header. (In my case, this is running on localhost:43222.)\r\n2. Create a second server that contains a `proxy` object in package.json which redirects requests to the server created in step 1. (In my case, this is running on localhost:4000.)  \r\nExample:  \r\n```\r\n    \"proxy\": {\r\n        \"/[Ss]ervice\": {\r\n            \"target\": \"http://localhost:43222\",\r\n            \"ws\": false\r\n        },\r\n        \"/[Ee]ditor\": {\r\n            \"target\": \"http://localhost:43222\",\r\n            \"ws\": false\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n3. Create a client app that makes a request to the server created in step 2 that will be passed on to the server created in step 1. In other words, make sure it matches a pattern defined in the proxy configuration. (In my case, this is running on localhost:3344.)\r\n4. Using the client app, initiate the CORS request.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe CORS handshake should succeed because the server returns the provided origin as allowed.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe server returns an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header for the host name of the first server (localhost:43222), not the host name of the client (localhost:3344). This causes the client to believe that it is not allowed to proceed.\r\n\r\nThe code responsible is in `packages\\react-dev-utils\\WebpackDevServerUtils.js`:\r\n```\r\n      onProxyReq: proxyReq => {\r\n        // Browers may send Origin headers even with same-origin\r\n        // requests. To prevent CORS issues, we have to change\r\n        // the Origin to match the target URL.\r\n        if (proxyReq.getHeader('origin')) {\r\n          proxyReq.setHeader('origin', target);\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems wrong to me. The documentation states that the proxy configuration supports any configuration supported by [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware#options) and [http-proxy](https://github.com/nodejitsu/node-http-proxy#options). This should include the `changeOrigin` option, which is being ignored here, and is false by default.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\nMaybe if I get more time later, I could create a demo. I've already invested considerable time into debugging and finding this bug and don't want to spend too much longer on it, if I can avoid it. Hopefully you can edit an existing project of your own to see the behaviour without needing to start from scratch."

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\"npx create-react-app --info\" is throwing an error but my stack is:\r\nnode v10.13.0\r\nnpm  v6.4.1\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. npx create-react-app my-app\r\n2. cd my-app\r\n3. add the following line in \"code\" block in file \"src/index.css\":\r\npadding:\r\n4. run \"npm run build\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\nThe build should throw a descriptive error what exactly is causing an error.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCreating an optimized production build...\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\nCannot read property 'includes' of undefined\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCheck steps to reproduce.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n  \r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n  \r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI've tried all of react-scripts versions from 2.0.3 to 2.1.0\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`react@16.6.1`, `react-scripts@2.* `\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThere are 3 simple steps to reproduce that, and you can follow them right now with no ads no credit card required using code sandbox. \r\n\r\n1. Open sandbox https://codesandbox.io/s/7v4onpq8j\r\n2. Wait for error overlay, it should appears immediately\r\n3. Close overlay and check that error was caught by `getDerivedStateFromError` because component state was updated\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI assume that if `getDerivedStateFromError` is defined so error overlay shouldn't be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nError overlay appears af.\r\n\r\nI even don't know what cause that - react or CRA or something else so I can't sleep all night of that reason. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/7v4onpq8j\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n  \r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n  \r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBundler does not recompile / App does not reload\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/z6yjkp4l4m\r\n\r\nPlease download from codesandbox since it's only reproducible locally.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n  \r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n  \r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/5076, https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/4893, https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/3909, https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1792"

			"body": "When using class properties decorators, the compiler doesn't generate the nessecary Object.defineProperty calls to make real properties, making the use of mobx or libraries which depend on decorators useless.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. use latest create-react-app (im my case 2.1.1) to create a new project with typescript support: ```npx create-react-app myproject --typescript```\r\n2. Add mobx, mobx-react to the project ```yarn add mobx mobx-react```\r\n3. Create a model class with ```@observable``` properties\r\n4. Decorate a React component with the ```@observer``` decorator and add the Model class as an instance to this component's props and use it in the render() method\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nThe observer get's notified, when property on the model has changed and therefore re-rendered\r\n\r\nActual:\r\nThe observer doesn't get notified\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong:\r\nThe decorators on properties of the class don't get generated as javascript, therefore the changed notification doesn't get fired and the observer doesn't get it.\r\n\r\nReason:\r\nThe reason is that in transpilation to javascript the decorators on class propeties/fields don't get generated.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar State = function State() {\r\n  Object(_Users_marcel_Source_test2_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classCallCheck__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"default\"])(this, State);\r\n  this.text = '';\r\n};\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\nvar _class, _descriptor;\r\nvar State = (_class = function State() {\r\n Object(_Users_marcel_Source_test2_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_classCallCheck__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__[\"default\"])(this, State);\r\n Object(_Users_marcel_Source_test2_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_initializerDefineProperty__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__[\"default\"])(this, \"text\", _descriptor, this);\r\n  this.text = '';\r\n}, (_descriptor = Object(_Users_marcel_Source_test2_node_modules_babel_runtime_helpers_esm_applyDecoratedDescriptor__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__[\"default\"])(_class.prototype, \"text\", [mobx__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_4__[\"observable\"]], {\r\n  configurable: true,\r\n  enumerable: true,\r\n  writable: true,\r\n  initializer: null\r\n})), _class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to make it work:\r\n1. add craco to the project ```yarn add @craco/craco```\r\n2. add class properties and decorators babel plugin also to this project ```yarn add --dev @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators```\r\n2. add following craco.config.js to the project:\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    babel: {\r\n        plugins: [\r\n            [\"@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators\", { legacy: true }],\r\n            [\"@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties\", { loose: true }]\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n3. change ```react-scripts start``` to ```craco start``` in package.json, scripts.\r\n\r\nNow it should work like expected.\r\n\r\nDemo Project:\r\nI've created a sample really quick and dirty project on github, with both variants, a non-working (on master) and a working (on branch working):\r\nhttps://github.com/metawave/property-decorator-demo/\r\n"

The fix adds this line, to decide whether the feature should be used or not.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/7973c81b912145350e8da68a3b91a17075b8b4fd/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod.js#L33\r\n\r\nThere are comments spread that recommend to set `\"homepage\": \".\"` or `\"homepage\": \"./\"` in `package.json`. See [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment#serving-the-same-build-from-different-paths).\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\nThe application is served under different domains prefixed with a path (\"/mypath\").\r\nSetting `\"homepage\": \"./mypath\"` was working fine, although I'm not sure if this is supported.\r\n\r\nBut the fix for assets urls in (s)css will not be applied, because of the condition: \r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/7973c81b912145350e8da68a3b91a17075b8b4fd/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.prod.js#L33\r\n\r\n### Fix\r\n\r\nWe could change the condition and paths will work in the described case.\r\n```js\r\nconst shouldUseRelativeAssetPaths = publicPath && publicPath.startsWith('./');\r\n```"

Initiated new project with CRA\r\n\r\n2. Installed this - npm install --save enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer.\r\n\r\n3. Created inside src folder a setupTests.js file for Enzyme configure. \r\n\r\n4. Created component and test file.  -- Card.js and Card.test.js\r\n\r\n5. Imported the component into the test file and wrote a test like this:\r\n`it('renders without crashing', () => {\r\n  console.log(shallow(<Card/>));\r\n});`\r\nJust followed the instructions on the docs.\r\n\r\n6. Run npm test command.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n\r\nI expected test's report about the component\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nI got this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32601939/48061663-70624f80-e1c8-11e8-83bd-7fd9f6291adc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI think jest has problem with reading the test's files inside the root directory. \r\nI run the eject command and got to those lines:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32601939/48061754-a7d0fc00-e1c8-11e8-8b52-2802393ff763.png)\r\n\r\nI removed the `rootDir` from the 2 lines on `testMatch` regex, run again the `npm test` , and it worked, but partially, because jest is checking `scripts\\test.js` file in the scripts folder as well, which leads to this exception:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32601939/48061847-ea92d400-e1c8-11e8-9dd0-b4dd6b681cbd.png)\r\n\r\nWhat should i do?"

				"body": "This fixes the issue that I just experienced while trying to figure out a TypeScript type error: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5771\r\n\r\nThe CRA webpack config includes polyfills for IE9+, so the TypeScript type checker should be using the type definitions for the latest JS features, including `Array.includes`, `Object.assign`, etc. The current default `tsconfig.json` limits TypeScript to only using ES5 features.\r\n\r\nNote that the Babel compilation doesn't actually care about `tsconfig.json`, and this doesn't affect any emitted JavaScript, because CRA isn't using TypeScript to compile the JS. It only affects type-checking, because TypeScript infers the type declarations from the \"target\". (Type declarations can also be overriden by setting the \"lib\" option.)\r\n\r\nI've confirmed that the new default `tsconfig.json` has the updated target, and that `yarn start` and `yarn build` are both running fine after this change.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Actually I just did [some research to find out what Babel supports](https://github.com/Timer/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/pull/2#issuecomment-437657838), and I think it would be better to use ES2018 here, because [Babel definitely supports ES2018](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/7658). And actually it's better to leave the target as \"es5\", and just add the \"lib\" option.\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2: Haha NOOOOOOOOO, this [was already fixed but wasn't released yet](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5684)!

				"body": "Hello, thanks for working on this awesome project! I've been trying to get everything working with TypeScript, and I just went down a huge rabbit hole before realizing that I had completely misunderstood how everything worked. (It's my first time using TypeScript, as well as all the bleeding edge versions for create-react-app, webpack, babel, etc.)\r\n\r\nWhen I ran `yarn start` for the first time with an `App.tsx`, I got this message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe detected TypeScript in your project (src/App.tsx) and created a tsconfig.json file for you.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe default `tsconfig.json` that it generates has this line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"target\": \"es5\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to use `Array.fill` in my code (and `Object.assign`, etc.), and this was giving me a TypeScript error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType error: Property 'fill' does not exist on type 'string[]'.  TS2339\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started investigating the issue, and I saw that I could fix it by using `\"target\": \"es6\"` in my `tsconfig.json`. But then I was concerned that the JS output from webpack would be ES6, and I would lose support for older browsers. I saw that I could also use:\r\n\r\n```\r\n target: \"es5\"\r\n lib: [\"es2018\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen TypeScript would emit ES5, but it would use the es2018 type declarations for type-checking (and would just assume that I was including my own polyfills.) That sounded a bit better, but then I was worried that I would lose tree shaking if TypeScript emitted ES5 (because then it would have `require` statements instead of ES6 modules.)\r\n\r\nI got very confused and was Googling things like \"TypeScript vs Babel\", and \"TypeScript => ES6 => Babel => ES5\", and there was no shortage of misleading answers and blog posts that were leading me down the wrong track.\r\n\r\nI finally started reading through the `react-scripts` webpack config and `babel-preset-react-app`, and I found that `create-react-app` is 100% Babel for all of the JS compilation, and it doesn't use any TS loaders (like `ts-loader` or `awesome-typescript-loader`.) Babel just strips all of the TS types and doesn't care about them. I also realized that the webpack config was using `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin` to run the TypeScript typechecking in a separate process, and then it asynchronously shows any TypeScript errors in the browser.\r\n\r\nAnd then it finally clicked! Or at least, I think I get it... Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of these points:\r\n\r\n* Babel doesn't care about `tsconfig.json` at all. It just strips all the TypeScript types, so this has nothing to do with the webpack build. \r\n* TypeScript is actually only used for type-checking, and the type-checking step doesn't actually care about `\"target\": \"es5\"` either, because it's not emitting any JavaScript. However, it does infer the type definitions from the target, and these can be overridden with the \"lib\" option.\r\n* The `create-react-app` webpack config already uses [`babel/preset-env` with a target of IE9](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/babel-preset-react-app/dependencies.js#L85-L91), so it does already include polyfills for `Object.assign`, `Array.from`, etc.\r\n\r\nSo is it correct that the only thing I need to do to fix these TypeScript errors is to just set `target: \"es6\"` (or `lib: [\"es2018\"]`) in my `tsconfig.json`? If so, I think it would be good if this was the default target."

Or is there an \"official\" way of setting up some boilerplate code and installing dependencies?\r\n\r\nI could have sworn I remember reading a tweet about Redux + CRA, maybe from Dan Abramov, or one of the Redux maintainers. But now all I'm finding on Google are a few Medium posts, and a lot of \"boilerplate\" repos from random developers. It would be great if there was an official `create-react-app` integration/plugin for Redux, and if a link to this could be included somewhere in the project README, or on the website."

				"body": "There is a similar issue #4152, but the main difference is that I am not using a service worker just yet and it's a static deployment, no backend serving the content. This error did not make sense to me for a long time as I was unable to reproduce it, but yesterday it finally happened. \r\n\r\nThe scenario is quite a simple, there is a deployed app using code splitting (and `React.lazy`) which is loaded into browser except that some chunks are not yet loaded because they weren't needed before. If we deploy a new version later and suddenly user decides to go into the part of the app he wasn't before, it is looking for an older chunk that's not already there and 💥 \r\n\r\nI am wondering what is the proper solution to this. If there would be some way how to catch that error, I could force reload the app which ultimately is what needs to happen I suppose.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I am a bit scared of registering service worker. The app is still heavy under development, but it's already in a production. Sadly there is nothing like release calendar on the team and it's not unusual to have 1-5 deployments to a production per week 🙄. Sometimes it's more or less a critical fix that should be delivered to customer ASAP. Is there some strategy to essentially detect that new version has been deployed and force the service worker to reload?"

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyarn --version : 1.3.2\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n  \r\n  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md\r\n  \r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS High Sierra 10.13.6\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 10.0.0 - /usr/local/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.3.2 - /usr/local/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 5.10.0 - /usr/local/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Chrome: 70.0.3538.77\r\n    Edge: Not Found\r\n    Firefox: Not Found\r\n    Internet Explorer: Not Found\r\n    Safari: 12.0.1\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.6.0 => 16.6.0\r\n    react-dom: ^16.6.0 => 16.6.0\r\n    react-scripts: 2.0.3 => 2.0.3\r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: 2.0.0-next.a671462c\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. add some svg\r\n2. import it like this\r\n ```javascript \r\nimport { ReactComponent as Rewards } from '../../assets/svg/dashboard/rewards.svg';\r\n```\r\n3. yarn start\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExpected that there will not be any warnings\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nbut got this \r\n```\r\nWarning: Invalid DOM property `xmlnsxlink`.

You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n  \r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n  \r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

This might take a couple of minutes.\r\nInstalling react, react-dom, and react-scripts...\r\n\r\nyarn add v1.5.1\r\n[1/4] 🔍  Resolving packages...\r\n[2/4] 🚚  Fetching packages...\r\nerror eslint@5.6.0: The engine \"node\" is incompatible with this module. Expected version \"^6.14.0 || ^8.10.0 || >=9.10.0\".\r\nerror An unexpected error occurred: \"Found incompatible module\".\r\ninfo If you think this is a bug, please open a bug report with the information provided in \r\ninfo Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/add for documentation about this command.\r\n\r\nAborting installation.\r\n  yarnpkg add --exact react react-dom react-scripts --...has failed.\r\n\r\nDeleting generated file... package.json\r\nDeleting generated file... yarn.lock\r\nDone.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  used 'create-react-app - <my-app>' \r\n\r\n received error after\r\nrunning node 9.8, yarn 1.5.1\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Did you try recovering your dependencies?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your module tree might be corrupted, and that might be causing the issues.\r\n  Let's try to recover it. First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n  \r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project. THIS DID NOT FIX my project\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here.)\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n  \r\n  https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md\r\n  \r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your answer here if relevant.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(paste the output of the command here)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. \r\n2. \r\n3. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write what you thought would happen.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write what happened. Please add screenshots!)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Paste the link to an example project and exact instructions to reproduce the issue.)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n  \r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing. In that case we'll tag an issue as having a low priority,\r\n  and eventually close it if there is no clear direction.\r\n  \r\n  We still appreciate the report though, as eventually somebody else might\r\n  create a reproducible example for it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"
